To get RoboRally to start you need to be in StarRoboRally class, where you need to get RoboRally to start up.
You can do this by hitting the play button in your IDE (VSCode or IntelliJ).

After starting up RoboRally, you need to go to the tab where you can choose either to start a new game, where you get to choose how many players there is gonna be playing the game. There is also a "load game" option under the tab but it is not working right now.

Then every player is getting programming-cards where they can play them on the register and there after press to excicute every registere for every player.

Then there is only alot of hours of fun game.
